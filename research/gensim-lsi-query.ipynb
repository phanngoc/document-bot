      "RQ (_Redis Queue_) is a simple Python library for queueing jobs and processing\n",

      "\n",
      "RQ requires Redis >= 3.0.0.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Getting Started\n",
      "\n",
      "First, run a Redis server. You can use an existing one. To put jobs on queues,\n",
      "you don’t have to do anything special, just define your typically lengthy or\n",
      "blocking function:\n",
      "\n",
      "    \n",
      "    \n",
      "    import requests\n",
      "    \n",
      "    def count_words_at_url(url):\n",
      "        resp = requests.get(url)\n",
      "        return len(resp.text.split())\n",
      "    \n",
      "\n",
      "Then, create a RQ queue:\n",
      "\n",
      "    \n",
      "    \n",
      "    from redis import Redis\n",
      "    from rq import Queue\n",
      "    \n",
      "    q = Queue(connection=Redis())\n",
      "    \n",
      "\n",
      "And enqueue the function call:\n",
      "\n",
      "    \n",
      "    \n",
      "    from my_module import count_words_at_url\n",
      "    result = q.enqueue(count_words_at_url, 'http://nvie.com')\n",
      "    \n",
      "\n",
      "Scheduling jobs are similarly easy:\n",
      "\n",
      "    \n",
      "    \n",
      "    # Schedule job to run at 9:15, October 10th\n",
      "    job = queue.enqueue_at(datetime(2019, 10, 8, 9, 15), say_hello)\n",
      "    \n",

      "    job = queue.enqueue_in(timedelta(seconds=10), say_hello)\n",
      "    \n",
      "\n",
      "You can also ask RQ to retry failed jobs:\n",
      "\n",
      "    \n",
      "    \n",
      "    from rq import Retry\n",
      "    \n",

      "## Installation\n",
      "\n",
      "Simply use the following command to install the latest released version:\n",

      "    \n",
      "\n",
      "## High Level Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "There are several important concepts in RQ:\n",
      "\n",
      "  1. `Queue`: contains a list of `Job` instances to be executed in a FIFO manner.\n",
      "  2. `Job`: contains the function to be executed by the worker.\n",
      "  3. `Worker`: responsible for getting `Job` instances from a `Queue` and executing them.\n",
      "  4. `Execution`: contains runtime data of a `Job`, created by a `Worker` when it executes a `Job`.\n",
      "  5. `Result`: stores the outcome of an `Execution`, whether it succeeded or failed.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Project History\n",
